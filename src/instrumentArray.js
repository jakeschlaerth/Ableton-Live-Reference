        blurb: "Electric is a software electric piano based on the classic instruments of the seventies, and developed in collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems. Each component of these instruments has been modeled using cutting edge physical modeling technology to provide realistic and lively sounds. Physical modeling uses the laws of physics to reproduce the behavior of an object. In other words, Electric solves, in real time, mathematical equations describing how its different components function. No sampling or wavetables are used in Electric; the sound is simply calculated in real time by the CPU according to the values of each parameter. Electric is more than a simple recreation of vintage instruments; its parameters can be tweaked to values not possible with the real instruments to get some truly amazing new sounds that still retain a warm acoustic quality.",
